# Nanoko Backend

_The backend for the Nanoko project_

</div>

## Introduction

Nanoko is a project that aims to help New Zealand Year 9-10 students with their Numeracy, with the integration of Artificial Intelligence.

## Features

- Asynchronous First: All the code is written in asynchronous style, with the use of FastAPI and SQLAlchemy.
- Easy Development: The project is well-structured and documented, making adding new features and fixing bugs easier.
- Pydantic Validation: All the data is validated using Pydantic, ensuring data integrity and security.
- Security: Due to the use of JWT authentication, the backend is secure by design, with the dependency injection design of FastAPI.
- Unit Tests: All the code is covered by unit tests, ensuring reliability and maintainability.
